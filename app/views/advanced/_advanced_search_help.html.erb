        <li>Select "match all" to require all fields.
        </li>

        <li>Select "match any" to find at least one field.
        </li>

        <li>Combine keywords and attributes to find specific items.
        </li>

        <li>Use quotation marks to search as a phrase.

        <li>Use "+" before a term to make it required. (Otherwise results matching only some of your terms may be included).</li>

        <li>Use "-" before a word or phrase to exclude.

        <li>Use "OR", "AND", and "NOT" to create complex boolean logic. (Please use capital letters for logical connectives.) You can use parentheses in your complex expressions. </li>
        <li>Truncation and wildcards are not supported - word-stemming is done automatically.</li>
        <!--<li>Use "TO" syntax to search publications in range of years. For example, if you want to search publications in the year range 1900-1930, you can put "1900 TO 1930" in the "Publish Date" field.</li>-->
